# hello-world

Hello Sea Creatures,

  My name is Alex and I love to code. I began my coding journey through a work program that put me through a class teaching me skills outside of the ones needed for the job. When the offer for a class on Web Development came up I was curious and signed up to take part. I was slighty apprehensive because sometimes me and technology do not get along but after 5 months of learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a little bit of Ruby, I was in love with it. Now I have set my sites more towards the Data side and hope to get a job as a Data Scientist in the forseable future.
